Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning


Problem Statement:
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at Microsoft, tasked with enhancing the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents. Utilizing the comprehensive GUIDE dataset, your goal is to create a classification model that categorizes incidents as true positive (TP), benign positive (BP), or false positive (FP) based on historical evidence and customer responses. The model should be robust enough to support guided response systems in providing SOC analysts with precise, context-rich recommendations, ultimately improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments.
You need to train the model using the train.csv dataset and provide evaluation metrics—macro-F1 score, precision, and recall—based on the model's performance on the test.csv dataset. This ensures that the model is not only well-trained but also generalizes effectively to unseen data, making it reliable for real-world applications.


Business Use Cases:
The solution developed in this project can be implemented in various business scenarios, particularly in the field of cybersecurity. Some potential applications include:
Security Operation Centers (SOCs): Automating the triage process by accurately classifying cybersecurity incidents, thereby allowing SOC analysts to prioritize their efforts and respond to critical threats more efficiently.
Incident Response Automation: Enabling guided response systems to automatically suggest appropriate actions for different types of incidents, leading to quicker mitigation of potential threats.
Threat Intelligence: Enhancing threat detection capabilities by incorporating historical evidence and customer responses into the triage process, which can lead to more accurate identification of true and false positives.
Enterprise Security Management: Improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments by reducing the number of false positives and ensuring that true threats are addressed promptly.
